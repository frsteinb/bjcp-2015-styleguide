        <overall-impression date="2019-12-22 09:22:56" author="Fe2O3" addr="172.21.0.16">An IPA with the fruitiness and spiciness derived from the use of Belgian yeast. The examples from Belgium tend to be lighter in color and more attenuated, similar to a tripel that has been brewed with more hops. This beer has a more complex flavor profile and may be higher in alcohol than a typical IPA.</overall-impression>
